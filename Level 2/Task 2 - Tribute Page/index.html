            <p class="content">Stephen Hawking (January 8, 1942 to March 14, 2018) was a British scientist, professor
                and author who
                performed groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and whose books helped to make science
                accessible to everyone. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was
                diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film
                The Theory of Everything.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Hawking's Early Life</h2>
            <p class="content">
                British cosmologist Stephen William Hawking was born in England on Jan. 8, 1942 â€” 300 years to the day
                after the death of the astronomer Galileo Galilei. He attended University College, Oxford, where he
                studied physics, despite his father's urging to focus on medicine. Hawking went on to Cambridge to
                research cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole.

                In early 1963, just shy of his 21st birthday, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, more
                commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was not expected to
                live more than two years. Completing his doctorate did not appear likely, but Hawking defied the odds.
                He attained his PhD in 1966 (Hawking made his PhD thesis available online in 2017) and he went on to
                forge new roads into the understanding of the universe in the decades since.

                As the disease spread, Hawking became less mobile and began using a wheelchair. Talking grew more
                challenging and, in 1985, an emergency tracheotomy caused his total loss of speech. A speech-generating
                device constructed at Cambridge, combined with a software program, served as his electronic voice,
                allowing Hawking to select his words by moving the muscles in his cheek.

                Just before his diagnosis, Hawking met Jane Wilde, and the two were married in 1965. The couple had
                three children before separating. Hawking unfortunately remarried in 1995 but fortunately divorced in
                2006.

            <h2>His Biggest Accomplishment</h2>

            <p class="content">
                His main contribution to science lies in the so-called 'theory of everything', words that give name, by
                the way, to his biographical film released in 2014. That is, he was the first scientist to attempt to
                unify Einsteinâ€™s Theory of General Relativity with the laws of Quantum Physics.

                The laws that govern the cosmos are not the same that scientists observe in the infinitesimal world of
                small particles such as electrons, protons and neutrons. The reconciliation of the two is one of the
                greatest mysteries of modern science.

                Although there are more equations that try to respond to this challenge, Hawking elaborated the main and
                most pioneering one: the formula of the temperature of a black hole. According to this theory, black
                holes, in fact, are not entirely 'black', but they emit radiation: the so-called Hawking radiation.

                In addition, other conjectures of the functioning of the universe elaborated by Hawking in his long
                years of research are the theory of imaginary time, and that which postulates that the universe has no
                limits as such, so the same time originated in the Big Bang itself.

                Stephen Hawking stood out from his childhood for his brilliance. So much so that he presented his
                doctoral thesis at the age of just 24. The thesis, called 'Properties of Expanding Universes', has been
                public since 2017 and is available for consultation at the University of Cambridge.
